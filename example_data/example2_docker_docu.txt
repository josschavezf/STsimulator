        7) User input


        What data do you want to use for simulation? 5


        Would you like to download this data table locally (y/n)? [default: n]
        Using default: n


        Unique cell types detected in expression data: 6


        Do you want to simulate new cells (y/n)? [default: n. The alternative is to simulate new expression data for existing cells].    y


        Number of simulated cells [default = 10,000]:   5000


        Cells closer than this cutoff will be considered overlapping to each other and all but one will be removed (range: 0-0.1 of the slide length/width) [default = 0.02]:     0


        Available methods for determining window on existing ST data
        -----------------------------------


        1) rectangle
        2) convex
        3) convex2
        4) convex3
        5) convex5
        6) network


        Method for determining window on existing ST data [default = convex5]: 
        Using default: convex5


        **** Provide simulation parameters for expression profiles ****


        Sequencing depth ratio between simulated and reference data [default = 1]? 

        Using default: 1


        Do you want to mimic gene-gene correlation of the reference data (y/n)? [default: n, simulates independent genes]
Note: Select “y” only if the gene-gene correlation is pre-estimated for each cell type. STsimulator provides functions/pipelines for estimating and saving gene-gene correlation, which can be served as input here.

        Using default:  n


        Add cell-cell interactions - expression associated with cell-cell distance? (y/n) [default: n]       y


        Prompts for adding cell-cell interaction: 


        Choose from cell types
        --------------
