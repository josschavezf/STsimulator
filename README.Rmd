# `STsimulator`

## ST simulator for 'de novo' spatial patterns

Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data are providing limited spatial patterns and cell-cell interactions. STsimulator generates de novel spatial patterns using snRNAseq or single-cell SRT as reference. 




### Installation and load R package 

You can install the latest version directly from GitHub with [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("songxiaoyu/RPackage/STsimulator")
library(STsimulator)
````

### Installation and load docker to guided simulation 

### Example 1: Simulate 



### Example 2: Correlation between one gene X and one gene Y in a cell type. 



### Example 3: Correlation between one gene X and one gene Y in a cell type.
